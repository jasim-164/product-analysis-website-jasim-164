  * React Routing and Netlify Redirects
Netlify makes these redirect configurations so easy with the following steps;
    * In your favorite code editor on your local Machine,
    * Locate the Public folder, create a file with the name “_redirects” (without the quotes).
    * Open the “_redirects” file, and write /* /index.html 200
